## 1. Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.
The dataset used for this project is a real-world dataset containing transactions made by credit cards, with a classification of whether each transaction is fraudulent or not.

## 2. Dataset 

The dataset used is creditcard.csv, which consists of:

- A large number of transactions with various features.

- A highly imbalanced distribution of fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

- Loading the dataset using Pandas.

- Checking for missing values and handling them accordingly.

- Feature scaling and selection.

- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## 4. Model Training

- Logistic Regression is used as a baseline model.

- Other possible models can be explored, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.

## 5. Model Evaluation

- The performance of the model is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- Addressing the issue of imbalanced data using techniques like SMOTE or class weighting.

## 6. Results and Insights

- Discussion on the effectiveness of the chosen model.

- Insights into how well fraudulent transactions are detected.

- Possible improvements and future work.

## 7. How to run the Project

1. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step.

3. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance and make necessary modifications.

## 8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in detecting fraudulent transactions.
Future improvements can include trying different models, tuning hyperparameters, and using deep learning techniques.
